# NLP Project (Spam Classification + News Title Classification)

There are 2 NLP projects in this repo (Spam Classification + News Title Classification)

To run Spam Classification code :
- read "Task Data Scientist.doc" for task Instruction
- go to "Spam Data Extraction-ML-Finalz.ipynb" file code
- run the code
- in the code there are several models that can be compared for their classification performance
- Overral, Linear SVM got the best accuracy (over 90 % accuracy)
- Cheers !

To run News Title Classification code : 
- read "Task Data Scientist.doc" for task Instruction
- go to "News Title Extraction-ML_Finalz.ipynb" file code
- run the code
- in the code there is only one model using SGD-SVM ,however, you can add Multi-Nomial Naive Bayes model (from Spam classification previous code) to this code and its work well too or adding MLPClassifier from scklearn library.
- Overall, SGD-SVM got good accuray (over 91% accuracy) and has low computation cost compared to MLPClassifier (although MLPClassifier perform slightly better). Multi-Nomial Naive Bayes works well too (around 89-90% accuracy)
- Cheers !
